## Consider creating three websocket connection to a server
=> context => server => wss://echo.websocket.org
=> connect => {{server}} => id1
=> connect => {{server}} => id2
=> connect => {{server}} => id3

## Send the message on first websocket
## And verify other two connection got the resp
=> send => {{id1}} => payload-A1 =>  payload-A1
=> send => {{id1}} => payload-A2
=> send => {{id2}} => payload-B1
=> send => {{id3}} => payload-C1
=> debug

=> check_recv => {{id1}} => payload-A2
=> check_recv => {{id2}} => payload-B1
=> check_recv => {{id3}} => payload-C1

=> send => {{id1}} => payload-A10
=> send => {{id1}} => payload-A11
=> send => {{id1}} => payload-A12

=> check_recv => {{id1}} => A10 => A11 => A12

## disconnect all websocket
=> disconnect => {{id1}}
=> disconnect => {{id2}}
=> disconnect => {{id3}}

## If you try to send one it will give error
# => send => {{id1}} => payload1
# => check_recv => {{id1}} => error
